            <p>Believe it or not, but there are people who are a tad bit lazy when it comes to taking care of their bikes. After some time they come up with many problems on the bike. And all of this could be avoided if they had taken a bit care of it. Periodic maintainence is very important. This helps your bike to perform at its peak and helps you to have a problem free ride.</p>
            <p>The more you know the better, am I right? Some of the ways you can know more about your motorcycle are:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Taking time to read the user manual</li>
                <li>Joining some motorcycle clubs, the fellow motorcyclists can help you to gain more about your bike.</li>
                <li>Know which tools to use with help of your tools specialist or your mechanic.</li>
            </ol>
            <code>Remember a healthy bike makes the rider happy:)</code>

            <header>Changing your oil regurlarly</header>
            <p>Every bike requires regular oil change.The golden rule is to change your engine oil every 5000km to 10000km. Though this range varies throughout different models. Beware that your ike consumes more oil in summer than in winter. So the oil filters should be changed regularly with oil.</p>
            <p>Generally, when you service your bike timely, this includes oil change by default. The frequency of oil change depends on two factors. They are:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>How old is your bike? Newer bikes generally run efficiently and goes longer without oil change.</li>
                <li>What sort of oil you use? While the newer synthetic oils are a bit more expensive tend to last longer.</li>
            </ol>
            <code>Give your bike good oil just like you drink healthy water.</code>

        <section class="main-section" id="Check_Your_Tyres">
            <header>Check Your Tyres</header>
            <p>Tyre maintainance is a fundamental part of taking care of bike. When you aregoing for a long drive/journey, it's a good idea to actually have a quick check like looking for tears, holes and cracks. You also need to make sure pressure is normal. You should be wary that environmental conditions afftects your tyre-life. Even in the right climate conditions tyres start to become worse so its a good idea you timely replace your tyres.</p>
            <p>The volume of air/the amount of inflation of tyre  affects the performance of the bike.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Over-inflated tyre gives less contact between the bike and the road and you lose some of those grip you want.</li>
                <li>Under-inflated tyres reduces stability and makes it harder to handle and brake. Check the tyre pressure using a pressure gauge.</li>  
            </ol>
            <code>Check the pressure while tyres are COLD only!</code>

        <section class="main-section" id="Chains_and_Batteries">
            <header>Chains and Batteries</header>
            <p>Your bike's chain is also a vital part of your bike where you constantly need to take care of.  They need to be well oiled in order to prevent excessive wear on those chains. Those chains usually last aboub 30000km or more, which means there is no need for frequent replacements. But you ought to check the tension time to time.</p>
            <p>The batteries that are put in our bikes usually have a life of about 2 years. Even if you take intensive care of battery, once it's time has comes then there is nothing that you can do. So consult a mechanic when buying a new battery/replacing one. You can maximize its lifespan by recharging it time to time. The batteries that are charged regurarly tend to have better lifespan than others.</p>
            <p>So they key points that you need to remember:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Check your bike's chains and lubricate and check their tension time to time.</li>
                <li>Recharge your batteries from time to time and also remember to check your spark plugs after running 6000km to 12000km.</li>
            </ol>
            <code>Remember your bike needs intensive care on those chains.</code>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Air_Filters_and_Brake_Pads">
            <header>Air Filters and Brake Pads</header>
            <p>Some of the internal and vital parts of the bike are always prone to airborne dust that could potentially damage your engine. And you definately do not want that to happen. So you need to clean the air filter every 10000 kilometres. It does an important job to protect the internal parts of the bike. Some of the environmental factors also makes a difference. If you ride in a dusty area  where there is always dust then you need to check and clean the filter every week. But if you live in a suburb area or a relatively less smokey and dusty area you do not need to clean out those filters for a quite long time.</p>
            <p>Something that we must not forget about is brake pads. It is very important that you keep those brake pads think and effective. You see your brake pad wear 2mm or less just change them. It is told that you ought to change the brake pads every 10000 to 15000 kilometres. Remember at slopes, if you have a lot of stops then you will wear out those brake pads faster. If you're not careful then you might be keeping your bike's and your life at risk.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>So remember to check your air filters so that you might not damage your internal parts.</li>
                <li>Brake pads is vital part that must not be neglected if they are quickly wearing out. So keep an eye out for those wears.</li>
                <li>Lastly do not take your bike for granted. Dont ignore if the ride changes or engine makes different sounds. Once you see signs of a problem immediately take action and take it to a mechanic. And also service it time to time. </li>
            </ol>
            <code>Remember you bike is not for granted. Take responsibility of it. And ride safely and responsively. :-)</code>
